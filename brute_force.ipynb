    "The issue of finding combinations of values and parameters is a recurring challenge in computing and is associated with the search for optimal or suitable solutions in vast spaces of possibilities. This type of problem is known a \"combinatorial optimization problem.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in optimizing parameters in machine learning models, it is necessary to find the ideal combination of hyperparameters, which may involve testing various values for each parameter, resulting in an extensive search space. Furthermore, in areas such as computer network routing, task scheduling, and logistics problems, determining the most efficient path, optimal order and timing of execution, and the best combination of vehicles, routes, and cargo, respectively, are complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes these problems especially challenging in computing is their combinatorial nature, which implies that the number of possible combinations grows exponentially with the size of the input data or the number of parameters to be optimized. Consequently, as the size of the problem increases, the time required to find the optimal solution grows significantly. Additionally, many of these problems are classified as NP-hard, which means that there is no known efficient algorithmic solution that works for all cases.\n",

    "One possible solution to tackle the challenge of combinatorial optimization problems is through the use of a brute-force algorithm. The brute-force approach involves systematically trying out all possible combinations of values or parameters and evaluating each combination's performance to find the optimal solution. While it may not be the most efficient method, especially for large problem sizes, it <strong>guarantees</strong> that the best solution within the search space will be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of optimizing hyperparameters for machine learning models, a brute-force algorithm would exhaustively test different combinations of parameter values, allowing us to determine the best configuration for the model. Similarly, for complex tasks like computer network routing, logistics problems, or task scheduling, the brute-force algorithm would explore all feasible combinations to find the most efficient path, schedule, or assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of the brute-force algorithm due to its exponential growth $(O(!n))$ in computation time with increasing problem size. As the search space expands, the algorithm becomes increasingly impractical for large-scale problems. Therefore, for NP-hard problems, where finding an efficient solution remains challenging, other optimization techniques such as heuristic algorithms, genetic algorithms, or dynamic programming may be more suitable to strike a balance between time and solution quality.\n",

The number of permutations grows factorially with the number of cities, resulting in a combinatorial explosion.\n",

For instance, if the farmer wants to visit 15 cities, the number of permutations would be 15! = 1,307,674,368,000, which is an enormous number of possibilities to explore. This becomes even worse when working with **continuous** values, as they can be expressed with infinite possibilities, and a BFO algorithm may be stuck forever trying to find the best solution."
